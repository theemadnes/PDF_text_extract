Description: PDFMiner is a tool for extracting information from PDF documents.
        Unlike other PDF-related tools, it focuses entirely on getting 
        and analyzing text data. PDFMiner allows to obtain
        the exact location of texts in a page, as well as 
        other information such as fonts or lines.
        It includes a PDF converter that can transform PDF files
        into other text formats (such as HTML). It has an extensible
        PDF parser that can be used for other purposes instead of text analysis.
